# Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Missing Vendor Pages (COMPLETED)
**Status**: All 5 missing vendor pages created and functional

**Files Created**:
1. `app/vendor/contracts/page.tsx` - Contract listing with status tracking
2. `app/vendor/quotations/page.tsx` - Quotation management
3. `app/vendor/documents/page.tsx` - Document library with categories
4. `app/vendor/invoices/page.tsx` - Invoice tracking and creation
5. `app/vendor/payments/page.tsx` - Payment history and status

**Features Implemented**:
- Search and filter functionality
- Status badges and indicators
- Statistics cards
- Responsive layouts
- Mock data for testing
- Links to detail pages (routes to be created)

**Result**: 404 errors resolved for all missing vendor menu items

---

### Phase 2: Role-Based Routing (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Core role system and routing guards implemented

**Files Created/Modified**:
1. `types/index.ts` - Updated User interface with all 6 roles (ADMIN, USER, BUYER, MANAGER, FINANCE, VENDOR)
2. `types/index.ts` - Added Ability interface for permission management
3. `lib/auth/guards.ts` - Complete role-based access control system
4. `app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard placeholder
5. `app/buyer/dashboard/page.tsx` - Buyer dashboard placeholder
6. `app/finance/dashboard/page.tsx` - Finance dashboard placeholder

**Features Implemented**:
- Role hierarchy system (ADMIN can access all, MANAGER > BUYER > USER, etc.)
- Route guards (`requireAdmin`, `requireBuyer`, `requireVendor`, `requireFinance`)
- `getRoleBasedRedirect()` - Automatic redirect to appropriate dashboard
- `isRouteAllowed()` - Route permission checking
- Placeholder dashboards for ADMIN, BUYER, and FINANCE roles

**Route Structure**:
- `/admin/dashboard` → ADMIN only
- `/buyer/dashboard` → BUYER, MANAGER, USER, ADMIN
- `/finance/dashboard` → FINANCE, ADMIN
- `/vendor/dashboard` → VENDOR only

## 🚧 In Progress / Next Steps

### Phase 3: Admin Dashboard Structure (NEXT)
**Priority**: HIGH

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Create admin layouts with navigation
2. Implement tenant provisioning pages
3. Build organizational hierarchy management
4. Create master data configuration pages
5. Implement user management interface
6. Add configuration validation tools

**Estimated Files**: ~30-40 new files

---

### Phase 4: Buyer/Finance Dashboards
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Create buyer procurement workflow pages
2. Implement tender management interfaces
3. Build finance invoice/payment pages
4. Add workflow tracking components

**Estimated Files**: ~25-35 new files

---

### Phase 5: Workflow Components
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Create reusable workflow components
2. Implement status tracking visualizations
3. Build form components for workflows
4. Add document upload components

**Estimated Files**: ~15-20 new files

---

### Phase 6: API Integration
**Priority**: HIGH

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Create RTK Query API slices for:
   - Admin API (`store/api/adminApi.ts`)
   - Workflow API (`store/api/workflowApi.ts`)
   - Tender Workflow API (`store/api/tenderWorkflowApi.ts`)
   - Finance API (`store/api/financeApi.ts`)
2. Update base API configuration
3. Add tenant header injection
4. Implement error handling

**Estimated Files**: ~5-7 new files

---

### Phase 7: Wire Up to Backend
**Priority**: HIGH

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Replace mock data with real API calls
2. Implement loading states
3. Add error handling
4. Test end-to-end flows

---

## 📊 Current State

### Working Features
✅ All vendor pages accessible (no 404 errors)
✅ Role-based type system
✅ Auth guards and permission checks
✅ Multiple dashboard placeholders
✅ Consistent UI/UX across pages

### Pending Integration
⏳ Middleware update for role-based routing
⏳ Login flow redirect based on role
⏳ Admin configuration pages
⏳ Buyer workflow pages
⏳ Real API integration

---

## 🔧 Testing Instructions

### Test Vendor Pages (Working Now)
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
- http://localhost:3001/vendor/contracts
- http://localhost:3001/vendor/quotations
- http://localhost:3001/vendor/documents
- http://localhost:3001/vendor/invoices
- http://localhost:3001/vendor/payments

All pages should load without 404 errors.

### Test Dashboard Placeholders (Working Now)
Navigate to:
- http://localhost:3001/admin/dashboard
- http://localhost:3001/buyer/dashboard
- http://localhost:3001/finance/dashboard

All dashboards should display with placeholder content.

### Test Role System (Implemented, Needs Integration)
The role guards are ready but need to be integrated into:
1. Middleware for route protection
2. Login flow for automatic redirection
3. Navigation menus for role-based display

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Mock Data**: All pages use mock data initially for rapid development and testing
2. **Consistent Patterns**: All pages follow the same layout structure for maintainability
3. **TypeScript Strict**: All new code follows strict TypeScript patterns
4. **Component Reusability**: UI components from shadcn/ui used throughout
5. **Role Hierarchy**: ADMIN has full access, roles have specific scopes

### Technical Debt
- Need to implement middleware integration for role routing
- Need to update login redirect logic
- Mock data needs to be replaced with real API calls
- Detail pages (/:id routes) need to be created
- Form validation needs to be added

### Performance Considerations
- Pages are client-side rendered ('use client')
- Can be optimized to server components later
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists
- Add pagination for production data

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Phase

To continue implementation:

1. **Update Middleware** (`middleware.ts`):
   - Add role checking
   - Implement route protection
   - Add automatic redirection

2. **Update Login Flow**:
   - Use `getRoleBasedRedirect()` after successful login
   - Store user role in Redux/session

3. **Start Admin Pages**:
   - Begin with tenant provisioning
   - Then organizational structure
   - Finally master data management

4. **Create API Slices**:
   - Start with adminApi.ts
   - Add endpoints as needed
   - Wire up to components
